## Description

Test the [APP](https://itsmesamrat-german-credit-card-assessment-a-streamlitapp-9p457k.streamlit.app/).

Streamlit is a great choice for anyone who wants to develop web applications quickly and efficiently. Its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers alike with its intuitive API and rich ecosystem.

Another advantage of Streamlit is its ability to integrate with a wide range of data science libraries and tools, including pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. This makes it an ideal choice for data scientists and developers who want to quickly prototype and test their models and algorithms in a web-based environment.

These are some the reasons for me choosing Streamlit. You can check out my article on Streamlit and how this model was deployed in this [article](https://medium.com/@itsmeSamrat/german-credit-card-assessment-a-streamlit-based-app-1f9fdd4c14c2)
