## Description

Credit card assessment is a crucial process in the financial industry that helps lenders evaluate the creditworthiness of their potential customers. This assessment involves analyzing various factors such as the applicant‚Äôs credit history, income, employment status, age, housing, saving account amount, purpose, credit amount, and debt-to-income ratio, among others.

So, for our project, we have data set of German credit card customers and they are assessed as good or bad risk, according to the set attributes. We have 6 categorical variables and 4 numerical variables.We will be handling the categorical variables and numerical variables separately. This makes us easy to perform EDA on our dataset.

In EDA, we check if there are any null values or NaN values, duplicated values, the overall summary of the dataset, outliers, count plots, and histogram for the distribution, change categorical values to numerical for the machine learning model and finally scale the numerical values. After all these have been performed, we combine the categorical and numerical data frames and sent them to the random forest classifier and we got an accuracy of 0.8 with the random forest classifier.

After which we deploy the model using streamlit. The streamlit sub-directory has the files which we will be using for deployment. To test the streamlit app, [click here](https://itsmesamrat-german-credit-card-assessment-a-streamlitapp-9p457k.streamlit.app/).
